# Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.
[Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is created by [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/), you can find him as [topaz](https://github.com/topaz) on GitHub.

This repository holds the input data and my code to solve the puzzles. Coding this was for fun and learning, there was no intention to optimize the code for efficiency, speed or whatsoever.
